i have no clue what i am doing
### TODO List:
- add maps and force people into testing
- need to add some way to view what maps are playable and pp values
- automagic tracking?
  - separate thread that wakes up every x minutes and scans all players in the db's recent n scores and adds them to the scores table if valid
